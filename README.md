# 🛟 Lifeguard AI

## 📌 Overview
Lifeguard AI is a Machine Learning-based disease prediction system that predicts possible diseases based on five user-selected symptoms. 
The system analyzes the combination of symptoms using a trained classification model and provides quick preliminary health insights.

The goal of this project is to promote early awareness and encourage users to consult medical professionals at the right time.
